**Busuu et tu**
_02/22/22_

Busuu's nice interface taught me French to A2 exclusively, albeit after years of casual use. All together I've used Busuu for hundreds of hours over 3 years. I've used it on long bus rides, in bed and more often than not, I'm getting that I plus one experience. 
The quick grammar and vocab question generator gets my approval for it's great assessment services but the voice recognition software's nothing special. It's also useful to have a list of words in the same app you're working with. It's not a quick reference and Busuu has no dictionary, but there's plenty of dialogues, which can be subtitled in other languages. 
There are deals, coupons and specials. I had a full year with Busuu for 40$ but when they send me the bill for the second year last week I responded sternly. Three years ago I had a monthlong trial. Half a year ago I bought a full year's subscription. 
I've done hundred of three to ten minute lessons. I mixed it with the book series Cosmopolite A2 afterwards because it wasn't enough and I used other free websites and class resources from the library. I also feel confident as an Elementary French Speaker.
