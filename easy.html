									<h2>What makes a language easy or hard?</h2>
									<p>Say you wanted to learn French. It’s an official language of 29 countries so you’ll get a lot of mileage out of it. A good place to start is the free trial of frantastique. French is one of the easiest languages for English speakers to learn. Ok French learners, I hear you, "What about hundreds of irregular verbs and prepositions? How are we supposed to know what letters are silent? And why on earth can't they use a new number for eighty instead of saying four twenties?” The words sound a bit different but about 35% of French vocabulary is similar to English. Words in different languages that come from the same root are called ‘cognates’, and they’re the main reason some languages are easier than others. The  is about learning vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar rules and shifting it that knowledge from the brain to the tongue.</[p/>
									<p>A language is easy if it is close to your tongue. Romance, Slavic, Celtic, Germanic, Indic, Iranian, Greek, Armenian and Albanian languages make up the Indo-European language family – hundreds of distinct languages whose root reaches back more than five millenia. French and Spanish are close siblings, while Albanian is the long lost cousin you found through gene analysis. The closer they are, the more features they share, like syntax (word order) and cognates.</p>
									<hr />
									
									<h3>Compare Indo-European languages</h3>
									<blockquote> English <i>my mother</i> {the 1st person genetive is <u>the head</u> of the noun phrase.}<hr /> 
										German, <i>meine mutter</i> {English and German's less common genetive, <i>mutter von mir</i> is end headed. Pronoun heads come after NPs.}<hr /> 
										French <i>ma mère</i> {German and French both use gendered genetive pronouns <i>mon père</i> is my father.}<hr />
										Irish <i>mo mháthair</i> {The possessive adjective <i>mo</i> adds a séimhiú and changes the first sound from <i>/m/</i> to <i>/w/</i>/.}<hr />
										Russian <i>moya mama</i> {Both the noun and the pronoun change in Russian}  <hr />
										Hindi <i>meree maan.</i> {Genetive is affected by formality, number and gender}  </blockquote>
									<p>Like this, their similarities seem obvious but it gets weirder when we look at Chinese.</p> 
									<p>They all put the genetive, my before the noun mother. Albanian is the only Indo-European language that changed that parameter. Albanian word order puts the noun first mama im and there’s one other European language that does that, Basque. In Basque, nire ama , mother ama comes before my nire. Furthermore, basic syntax in Basque is subject-object-verb and all Indo-European Languages, Subject-Verb-Object is . Comparatively, French may be easy for most Europeans but for speakers of Basque, Japanese or Turkish, it has an extra challenge of training the brain and the tongue to place the object before the verb.</p>
